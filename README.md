Hello! I'm a web developer currently focused on frontend and mobile development. I specialize in crafting intuitive and user-friendly interfaces using TypeScript and frameworks such as Next.js, React, React Native, and Angular. I also have meaningful experience with backend development, working with node.js and Java/Spring Boot, making me a versatile asset for delivering end-to-end web solutions.
